# KayakResults
Proof of concept for a result app for canoe/kayak races.

This is a work in progress. I want an app that you can load up on your laptop while connected to the network, take it off
to remote areas that are not connected and do registration and results, and then when you're back connected again, it will
sync up with the server again.

Still to come:
- Being able to register as a new race director
- Being able to create a new race
- Being able to edit an existing race
- Making all race results available in a read-only manner to non-registered people
- Being able to have more than one person doing registrations/results if you're connected to a network
